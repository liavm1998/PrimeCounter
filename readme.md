## Random Prime Counter

### Introduction

In our assignment, we utilized a provided random number generator to simulate an endless stream of numbers.
Our task was to count the number of prime numbers within this stream.
To achieve this, we parallelized the process to fully utilize all CPU cores.
We also improved the isPrime function where necessary.
Importantly, we adhered to a strict memory usage limit of 2MB.

Note, the project requires a gcc compiler
